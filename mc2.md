# Mini Challenge 2

 

## Full CRUDS support

 

### Acceptance Criteria

1. As an end user I would like to be able to create new posts so that I can share my perspective and experience with other users.

2. As an end user I would like to be able to update existing posts so that I can correct mistakes or keep information updated.

3. As an end user I would like to be able to delete posts so that I can remove posts that no longer represent my point of view for whatever reason.

4. As an end user I would like to view posts generated by other users so that I can stay up to date with what they share.

4.1. This includes generating a viewable list of posts.

4.2. This includes generating a detail view so that users can view one post at a time (in more detail).

5. Make sure your users can navigate the site through links or anchor tags directly on your site.

5.1. If your users have to type anything into the address bar to get from one point to the other, you know you still have work to do!



### Note

Implement any and all views, urlpatterns, templates and configurations to make these `user stories` true.

 

### Bonus

Add custom CSS and additional bootstrap components to improve user experience.
